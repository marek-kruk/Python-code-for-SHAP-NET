The aim of this work is to find an effective combination of modelling based on the boosting technique and the Shapley value calculation with the practise of evaluating an undirected graph model. For this purpose, we created a XGBoost-SHAP regression model in which the target variable is the cyanobacteria concentration and the model variables consist of 20 environmental factors. Then two partial correlation based graphs were created. First, Preliminary Network containing all features (with target variable) with original records of parameters and second, named SHAP-NET, based on the Shapley values of the independent variables from the SHAP model. It seems that using new combining machine learning and network tools as SHAP-NET it will be possible to further improve the idea of explainability of models in the field of XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence), and attempts to solve practical domain problems, as in this work, can contribute to progress in this area.
